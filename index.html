                <p>Koalas are declining in rapid numbers because the trees where they spend a majority of their time are being quickly chopped down. Activists need to take action to try and protect these animals’ habitats so they do not become a thing of
                    the past.

                        <p>Koalas are well-known as an icon of Australia and many people who visit Australia as tourists hope to see and hold a koala. But it's less well known that koalas in the wild are facing unprecedented pressure as their trees are cleared,
                            existing habitat becomes more vulnerable and isolated and more roads bisect their territories resulting in more koalas being run over.</p>

                <p>Loss of koala habitat is the major threat facing koalas today. Since white settlement of Australia, roughly 80% of the koala’s habitat has been destroyed and of what remains, most occurs on privately owned land and almost none is protected.</p>

    <!--SECTION 5: HOW TO HELP

    It’s not hard to see how we can help. There are many people who are working very hard to achieve the conservation of the koala and you can join them by visiting www.savethekoala.com. The only way to save koalas is to save their habitat, the eucalyptus
    forests where they live, and which they must have to survive. This is what the Australian Koala Foundation is trying to achieve. But they can't do it alone and they need the help of people like you. You may think that just one person cannot make any
    difference in helping koalas or in helping our environment generally, but if each person does even one little thing to help, it can add up to a lot of help.
